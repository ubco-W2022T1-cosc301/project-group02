# Analysis 3 - Availability of Clean Energy

## Research Questions

1. What is the most common global clean energy source?
2. Which countries have the lowest production of renewable energy? Are there any countries which produce no renewable energy?
3. What are the top 25 countries with the highest production of renewable energy? Is there a correlation between renewable energy production and GDP?

### What is the most common global clean energy source?

![Most Common Renewable Energy Source In the World](images/Analysis3_1.1.png)

This graph shows the most common clean energy sources in the world. Interestingly, hydro-electricity is the most common by a wide margin followed by nuclear electricity. This dataset only specifically mentions biofuels, hydro, nuclear, solar, and wind energy as renewable sources, with any others being categorized in an "other" category. The results in this graph contrast my original assumption, which was that solar as an energy source would be much more widely used than it is. It is important to note, however, that this dataset only shows data up to 2021, as 2022 has not yet been concluded, possibly explaining the discrepancy with my assumption.

### Which countries have the lowest production of renewable energy?

The graph above shows the top 10 lowest renewable energy producers in the world. Trinidad and Tobago produce the least amount of renewable energy in the world at less than 0.01 terawatt-hours. Additionally, Equatorial Guinea at 9th place produces over 0.1 terawatt-hours. This means that 8 countries in the world produce less than 0.1 terawatt-hours of renewable energy.

If we widen the scope to include 25 countries, we can start to see a couple interesting patterns. This graph does just that. 14 of the world's countries produce 0.5 terawatt-hours or less. Curiously, Yemen, the 15th lowest producer, is the only country that comes close to that half a terawatt-hour mark, sitting just above it. There are also more countries which produce between 0 and 0.5 terawatt-hours than there are countries which produce between 0.5 and 1 terawatt-hour.

After examining the world's lowest renewable energy producers, the data suggests that every country produces at least some renewable energy. It should be noted that several countries were not included in this analysis because of corrupt or missing data when it was collected by the owner. That being said, this surprised me as I was expecting there to be at least some countries which haven't adopted renewable energy yet.

### What are the top 25 countries with the highest production of renewable energy? Is there a correlation between renewable energy production and GDP?

On the other side of the spectrum, this graph shows the top 25 countries with the highest production of renewable energy sources measured in terawatt-hours. Unlike the previous research question, we want to see the top performing countries in renewable energy production. China has by far the highest production, followed by the United States and Brazil, with Canada being number four. Interestingly, the curve flattens out noticeably by the 10th country at Spain.

This graph shows the GDP of the top 25 countries shown above. The order is the same as the previous graph, listing each country by rank of its renewable energy production. Looking at this graph, there are no meaningful patterns to be seen. Here, the order of countries appears all over the place. Clearly, based on this graph, a country's GDP provides no indication of its production of renewable energy.
